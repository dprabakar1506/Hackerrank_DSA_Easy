Compare Two Linked Lists
-------------------------
Problem Description
-----------------------
Compare two singly linked lists to determine if they are identical in both structure and data values.

Solution Overview
-------------------
Iterates through both linked lists simultaneously, comparing data at each position and checking if both lists end at the same time.

Data Structure Used
---------------------
Singly Linked List: Linear data structure with nodes containing data and next pointer
Node: Basic unit storing integer data and reference to next node

Why This Data Structure is Efficient
---------------------------------------
Memory Efficient: Only stores necessary data and one pointer per node
Sequential Access: Natural for element-by-element comparison
Simple Structure: Straightforward traversal and comparison logic
Dynamic Size: Handles lists of any length

Algorithm Approach
-------------------
Traverse both lists simultaneously using two pointers
Compare data values at each corresponding position
Check if one list ends before the other
Return false if any mismatch found, true if both lists are identical

Time Complexity
----------------
Time Complexity: O(min(m,n)) - Where m and n are lengths of the two lists
Space Complexity: O(1) - Only uses pointer variables
